## Attendance Policy

Students are expected to complete course readings, participate in class discussions or other learning activities during the unit, and complete written assignments for each unit during the time of that unit. It is understood that there might be one week when active participation in ongoing class conversations and learning activities might be delayed. Beyond one week time, if there is an absence or lateness in participation (1) faculty must be notified in advance; (2) grades will be adjusted accordingly.

## Assignments

Students will be assigned assignments at the end of the lecture. Assignment due dates will be posted with each assignment. Given that an assignment is due every week, if you fall behind on an assignment, it will be extremely difficult to catch up as the next assignment depends on it.

## Assignment Grading

TBD

## Grading & Evaluation Standards

Grading will be based on the **absolute** grading system. In this grading system, a range of point values is assigned to a letter grade. The grading is absolute, irrespective of the grade of other students in the class. I do not round scores to the closest percentage.

## Grading Scheme

| Letter Grade | Range          |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| A            | 100% to 95.0%  |
| A-           | < 95.0% to 90.0% |
| B+           | < 90.0% to 87.0% |
| B            | < 87.0% to 84.0% |
| B-           | < 84.0% to 80.0% |
| C+           | < 80.0% to 77.0% |
| C            | < 77.0% to 74.0% |
| C-           | < 74.0% to 70.0% |
| F            | < 70.0% to 00.0% |

## Grade Breakdown

| Grades                   | Percentage |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Assignments & Projects   | 60%        |
| Exams                    | 25%        |
| Participation & Discussion | 15%        |

## Late Work Policy

Students must submit assignments by the deadline in the time zone noted in the syllabus. Students must communicate with the faculty prior to the deadline if they anticipate work will be submitted late. Work submitted late without prior communication with faculty will not be graded.

**Assignments** and **Grading** are expected to be completed by their respective due date. A 10% penalty applies for every day the assignment submission and/or demo is late after the due date. An assignment that is late 10 days or more will receive 0 points.

## Exams

In-person, subject-type pen and paper exam for 100 marks.

## End-of-Course Evaluation Surveys

Your feedback regarding your educational experience in this class is particularly important to the College of Professional Studies. Your comments will make a difference in the future planning and presentation of our curriculum.

At the end of this course, please take the time to complete the evaluation survey at [https://neu.evaluationkit.com](https://neu.evaluationkit.com). Your survey responses are completely anonymous and confidential. For courses 6 weeks in length or shorter, surveys will be open one week prior to the end of the courses; for courses greater than 6 weeks in length, surveys will be open for two weeks. An email will be sent to your Husky Mail account notifying you when surveys are available.

## Academic Integrity

A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the mission of Northeastern University. The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University.

As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and responsibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern University expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors.

Go to [http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/) to access the full academic integrity policy.

## Academic Integrity Violation

**Academic integrity violation will result in an automatic F grade in the course**. You may also be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution for further disciplinary action.
